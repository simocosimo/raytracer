# raytracer
Basic raytracer written in C++.\
I'm using this project as an excuse to learn the language, so you'll find things that aren't really necessary but did for the learning experience :)

I'm using [PPM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#PPM_example) for images just for semplicity. Will improve everything with time!

I found this video that explains some things about rgb colors, just click the image below!\
It's good if you wanna learn something, otherwise just add everything together :)
